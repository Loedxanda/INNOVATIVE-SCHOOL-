2. **Microservices Architecture** - Production ready
   - Separate AWS services for database (RDS), cache (ElastiCache)
   - Containerized deployment with ECS/EKS
   - Load balancing and auto-scaling

### 2. Local PC Deployment
- Prerequisites: Docker, Docker Compose, Git
- Automated installation with updated scripts
- Manual installation steps documented
- Environment configuration guidance

### 3. Mobile Application Development
Two approaches:
1. **Progressive Web App (PWA)**
   - Enhanced web experience
   - Offline capabilities
   - Installable on devices

2. **Native Mobile Applications**
   - React Native for cross-platform development
   - Access to device features (camera, biometrics)
   - Push notifications support
   - App Store deployment guidance

## Mobile Application Features
