## Architecture

Each service is designed as a microservice with:
- RESTful API endpoints
- Docker containerization
- Health checks and monitoring
- Scalable deployment
- Integration with main platform

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

3. Run a service:
   ```bash
   python -m learning_analytics.main
   ```

## Development

- Each service has its own directory with independent dependencies
- Services communicate via HTTP APIs
- Common utilities are shared in the `shared/` directory
- Models and data processing are in service-specific directories

## Deployment

Services can be deployed independently or as part of the main platform using Docker Compose.

## Monitoring

Each service includes:
- Health check endpoints
- Metrics collection
- Logging and error tracking
- Performance monitoring
